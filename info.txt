directory tree:
classes -- classes that get instanced multiple times
instances -- classes with only one instance that keep track of/manage something
libraries -- a bunch of usefull functions
resources
    configs -- text files that save program states and user customizations
    fonts
    images
    songs -- osu beatmaps
scenes -- the user interface. serve as a bridge between user input and the program. also visualize data.



coding conventions:
function get -- returns the main focus of the class or nil
function set -- sets a value to the main focus of the class
function check -- returns true or false

function construct -- gets called on a new instance of a class. only usefull for classes inside the classes dir
function init -- gets called on the first require of the class. needs to be at the bottom just before the return
function load -- gets called when the scene is loaded. only usefull for classes inside the scenes dir
function unload -- opposite of load

local variable or function in the root of a script -- if a variable or function shouldn't or doesn't make sense to be called by an outside source
